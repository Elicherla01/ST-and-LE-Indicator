# ST-and-LE-Indicator
Supertrend Entry + Lazy Exit Strategy
# Supertrend Entry + Lazy Exit Strategy

A comprehensive TradingView Pine Script indicator that combines **Supertrend entries** with **Lazy Exit** technology for improved swing trading performance.

## 🎯 Overview

This indicator uses Supertrend to identify entry points and implements a "Lazy Exit" system that reduces false exits while letting profitable trades run longer. Perfect for swing traders who want to catch trending moves early and hold winners with confidence.

## ✨ Key Features

### Entry System
- **Supertrend-based entries** with customizable ATR period and multiplier
- **Clean buy signals** when trend changes from bearish to bullish
- **Position tracking** prevents duplicate signals

### Lazy Exit System
- **Smart stop loss** that updates lazily (not on every bar)
- **Reduced whipsaws** compared to traditional trailing stops
- **Configurable sensitivity** and update delays
- **Entry-based calculations** for more logical stop placement

### Visual Elements
- **Real-time performance table** with 15+ metrics
- **Customizable table position** (4 corner options)
- **Color-coded indicators** (Supertrend: Green/Red, Lazy Exit: Orange)
- **Buy/Sell labels** with clear ST/LE designations
- **Background highlighting** based on position status

### Alerts & Tracking
- **Buy/Sell alerts** with optional bar confirmation
- **Signal counting** and performance metrics
- **Position duration tracking** 
- **Distance calculations** to key levels

## 📊 How It Works

### Entry Logic
1. **Supertrend calculation** using ATR-based bands
2. **Buy signal** triggers when Supertrend changes from bearish to bullish
3. **Position tracking** ensures only one entry per trend change

### Lazy Exit Logic
1. **Initial stop** set at entry price minus ATR multiplier
2. **Smart updates** only when:
   - Price gains ≥ threshold (in ATR terms)
   - New stop level is significantly higher
   - Minimum bars delay has passed
3. **Exit signal** when price closes below lazy stop
